=head1 Synopsis


    local resty_signal = require "resty.signal"
    local pid = 12345
    
    local ok, err = resty_signal.kill(pid, "TERM")
    if not ok then
        ngx.log(ngx.ERR, "failed to kill process of pid ", pid, ": ", err)
        return
    end
    
    -- send the signal 0 to check the existence of a process
    local ok, err = resty_signal.kill(pid, "NONE")
    
    local ok, err = resty_signal.kill(pid, "HUP")
    
    local ok, err = resty_signal.kill(pid, "KILL")


=head1 Functions


=head2 kill

B<syntax:> C<ok, err = resty_signal.kill(pid, signal_name_or_num)>

Sends a signal with its name string or number value to the process of the
specified pid.

All signal names accepted by L<signum> are supported, like C<HUP>,
C<KILL>, and C<TERM>.

Signal numbers are also supported when specifying nonportable system-specific
signals is desired.




=head2 signum

B<syntax:> C<num = resty_signal.signum(sig_name)>

Maps the signal name specified to the system-specific signal number. Returns
C<nil> if the signal name is not known.
